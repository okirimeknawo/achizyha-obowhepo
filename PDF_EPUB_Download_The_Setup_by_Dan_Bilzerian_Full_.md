Overview
Dan takes readers on a wild ride, from his anything-but-normal childhood to the insanity that has followed him on his journey to becoming one of the most famous people in the world. Read about his upbringing, military service, gambling, guns and other toys, and about girls. Lots of girls. 


 And for the first time, Dan talks openly about how he was able to live unapologetically live his dreams using a simple method that he calls The Setup. The Setup is jam-packed with crazy stories and incredible photos that bring readers into the world of Dan Bilzerian.
