PREORDER EYE OF THE RAVEN, THE EXCITING NEW VIKING ADVENTURE FROM TIM HODKINSON, NOW!
 
Alone in a foreign land, Viking warrior Einar must choose his loyalties in the face of war. The gripping new instalment in the Whale Road Chronicles.
 
 For the first time, Einar and the Wolf Coats find themselves divided, on opposing sides in a time of warfare: the Wolf Coats in Ireland, and Einar in the Saxon domains of England.
 
 Einar leads a warband for King Aethelstan, but struggles to find acceptance as a Norseman in Saxon lands. Can he truly make common cause with the wily king of the English, if that means Vikings like himself are now his enemies? The rewards of alliance with Aethelstan could be all he desires... or a brutal death.
 
 But other threats loom from the north and west. With war brewing and a great battle on the horizon, can Einar and his comrades reunite in time - or will a clash for the ages make their split a permanent one?
