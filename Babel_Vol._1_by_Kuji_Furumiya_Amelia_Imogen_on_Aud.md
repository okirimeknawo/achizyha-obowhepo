SWORDS, SORCERY, AND DICTIONARIES! College student Shizuku Minase has never been anything but ordinary. For all her eighteen years, she has been overshadowed by her sistersâ€™ confidence and charm. However, her life changes forever when sheâ€™s abruptly spirited away to a world of magic and terrible danger. There, she meets Erik, a handsome young man who studies this landâ€™s magic script. He offers to help her find a way back to Earth, but in exchange, he wants her to teach him Japanese. With their bargain struck, the pair sets out for Farsas, the kingdom of magic, beginning an adventure of fantasy and language.
