 In this highly anticipated sequel to the New York Times bestselling Better than the Movies, Wes and Liz struggle to balance their feelings for each other with the growing pains of being a college student.
 
 For a few beautiful months, Wes had his dream girl: strong-willed girl-next-door Liz. But right as the two were about to set off to UCLA to start their freshman year together, tragedy struck. Wes was left dealing with the fallout, which ultimately meant losing Liz in the process.
 
 Flash forward months and months later and Wes and Liz find themselves in college, together. In a healthier place now, Wes knows he broke Lizâ€™s heart when he ended things, but he is determined to make her fall back in love with him.
 
 Wes knows Liz better than anyone, and he has a foolproof plan to win her back with the rom-com worthy big gestures she loves. Only...Liz will have none of it. Wes has to scheme like a rom-com hero to figure out how to see her. Even worse, Liz has a new friend...a guy friend.
 
 Still, Wes wonâ€™t give up, adapting his clever plans and going hard to get Lizâ€™s attention and win back her affection. But after his best efforts get him nowhere, Wes is left wondering if their relationship is really over for good.
